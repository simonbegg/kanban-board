# ThreeLanes — Privacy Policy
**Last updated:** November 03, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how **Two Bees Consulting Ltd** (Company No. 07750344), trading as **ThreeLanes** (“**ThreeLanes**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”), collects, uses, shares, and protects your information when you use our kanban web application and related services (the “**Service**”).

We act as the **data controller** for personal data we process about you. For billing and payments, **Paddle** acts as our **merchant of record** and processes your payment data as an independent controller (and/or processor, as applicable) under its own terms and privacy notices.

If you have questions, contact **support@threelanes.app**.

## 6. Cookies & tracking
We use cookies and similar technologies to run the Service and, with your consent, for analytics.

- **Analytics cookies/SDKs**: **Seline Analytics** helps us understand aggregate usage.  
- **Consent management**: **Cookiehub** provides the consent banner and stores your preferences.

You can manage consent choices at any time via the cookie banner/settings. Refusing non‑essential cookies may limit analytics functionality but not core features.

## 7. International transfers
