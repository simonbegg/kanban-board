# Mobile Drag & Drop Fix

## Problem

On mobile devices, attempting to drag a card would scroll the page instead of dragging the card. This is because touch events were conflicting with the default scroll behavior.

---

## Solution

Implemented proper touch support for drag-and-drop using @dnd-kit sensors and CSS touch-action properties.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Added Touch & Mouse Sensors**
**File:** `components/supabase-kanban-board.tsx`

```typescript
import { 
  DndContext, 
  MouseSensor, 
  TouchSensor, 
  useSensor, 
  useSensors 
} from "@dnd-kit/core"

// Configure sensors for better mobile support
const mouseSensor = useSensor(MouseSensor)

const touchSensor = useSensor(TouchSensor, {
  activationConstraint: {
    delay: 250, // 250ms hold before drag starts
    tolerance: 5, // Allow 5px of movement during the delay
  },
})

const sensors = useSensors(mouseSensor, touchSensor)
```

**Why this works:**
- **MouseSensor** - Handles desktop drag with instant activation (no delay)
- **TouchSensor** - Handles mobile/touch with 250ms hold delay
- **Tolerance** - Allows 5px of finger movement during the hold delay (natural finger wobble)

---

### 2. **Added Sensors to DndContext**
**File:** `components/supabase-kanban-board.tsx`

```typescript
<DndContext
  sensors={sensors}  // ← Added this
  collisionDetection={pointerWithin}
  onDragStart={handleDragStart}
  onDragOver={handleDragOver}
  onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}
>
```

---

### 3. **Prevented Touch Scrolling on Draggable Areas**
**File:** `components/kanban-card.tsx`

```typescript
<div className="flex-1 touch-none">
  {/* Card title - draggable */}
  <h4>{task.title}</h4>
</div>
<div className="flex items-center gap-1 touch-auto" onPointerDown={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>
  {/* Edit/Delete buttons - clickable */}
  <Button onClick={handleEdit}>...</Button>
  <Button onClick={handleDelete}>...</Button>
</div>

<CardContent className="pt-0 touch-none">
  {/* Card content - draggable */}
  <p>{task.description}</p>
</CardContent>
```

**What `touch-none` and `touch-auto` do:**
- `touch-none` (CSS: `touch-action: none`) - Prevents scrolling on draggable areas
- `touch-auto` (CSS: `touch-action: auto`) - Allows normal touch interactions on buttons
- This selective approach allows drag on card while keeping buttons clickable

---

## How It Works

### Desktop Experience:
1. User clicks and drags card
2. MouseSensor activates **instantly**
3. Card follows mouse cursor smoothly
4. Drop to reorder

### Mobile Experience:
1. User **presses and holds** card for 250ms
2. TouchSensor activates (allows 5px wobble during hold)
3. Visual feedback (haptic/opacity change)
4. User **drags** card with finger
5. Drop to reorder
6. Page scrolling works normally when NOT holding a card

---

## User Experience

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Touching card scrolled the page
- ❌ Couldn't drag cards on mobile
- ❌ Frustrating mobile experience

### After Fix:
- ✅ **Press and hold** for 250ms to start drag
- ✅ Card follows finger movement
- ✅ Page scrolls normally when not dragging
- ✅ Smooth, intuitive mobile experience

---

## Configuration Details

### Activation Constraints:

**MouseSensor:**
```typescript
// No constraints - instant activation
```
- Desktop users expect immediate drag response
- Mouse precision means accidental drags are rare
- Smooth, instant feedback on click-and-drag

**TouchSensor:**
```typescript
activationConstraint: {
  delay: 250,     // 250ms hold required
  tolerance: 5    // 5px movement allowed during hold
}
```
- **delay: 250** - Short enough to feel responsive, long enough to distinguish from scroll
- **tolerance: 5** - Accounts for natural finger shake/wobble during hold

---

## Touch-Action CSS

### `touch-none` Class:
- Prevents default touch behaviors
- Allows drag library to handle all touch events
- Applied only to draggable cards, not entire page

### Alternative Values (not used):
- `touch-auto` - Default (allows scroll)
- `touch-pan-y` - Only vertical scroll
- `touch-pan-x` - Only horizontal scroll
- `touch-manipulation` - Allows scroll/zoom but removes double-tap zoom

We use `touch-none` for complete control during drag.

## Testing Checklist

### Desktop:
- [x] Click and drag works **instantly**
- [x] Cards follow mouse cursor smoothly
- [x] Drop to reorder works
- [x] Feels natural and responsive

### Mobile/Touch:
- [x] Press and hold card for 250ms
- [x] Visual feedback when drag activates
- [x] Card follows finger
- [x] Drop to reorder works
- [x] Page scrolls normally when not dragging
- [x] Scrolling doesn't interfere with drag

### Tablet:
- [x] Works with both touch and mouse/trackpad
- [x] Appropriate activation for each input type

---

## Browser Compatibility

### Touch-Action Support:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Android, iOS, Desktop)
- ✅ Safari (iOS, macOS)
- ✅ Firefox (Android, Desktop)
- ✅ Samsung Internet
- ✅ Opera Mobile

**Coverage:** 98%+ of mobile browsers

---

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Users:
- Drag-and-drop library provides keyboard support
- Tab to card, Space to pick up, Arrow keys to move
- Works independently of touch/mouse sensors

### Screen Readers:
- Proper ARIA labels should be added (future enhancement)
- Announce drag state changes
- Provide alternative reorder method

---

## Performance

### Sensor Overhead:
- **Minimal** - Sensors only active during drag
- No performance impact when not dragging
- Touch events are passive where possible

### Touch-Action Benefits:
- Browser can optimize rendering
- No scroll calculation needed on drag elements
- Smoother overall experience

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:

1. **Visual Drag Preview:**
   ```typescript
   // Add semi-transparent preview under finger
   <DragOverlay>
     <KanbanCard task={activeTask} />
   </DragOverlay>
   ```

2. **Haptic Feedback:**
   ```typescript
   onDragStart={() => {
     if (window.navigator.vibrate) {
       window.navigator.vibrate(50)
     }
   }}
   ```

3. **Adjustable Hold Delay:**
   ```typescript
   // User preference for hold duration
   const holdDelay = userPreferences.dragDelay || 250
   ```

4. **Long-Press Alternative Actions:**
   - 250ms hold = drag
   - 1000ms hold = show context menu
   - Quick tap = edit/view

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Buttons inside cards not clickable
**Solution:** Use `touch-auto` on interactive elements and `touch-none` only on draggable areas. Don't apply `touch-none` to entire card.

### Issue: Drag still scrolls page on mobile
**Solution:** Ensure `touch-none` is applied to draggable card areas (title, description)

### Issue: Mobile drag takes too long to activate
**Solution:** Reduce `delay` from 250ms to 150ms in TouchSensor

### Issue: Accidental drags on mobile
**Solution:** Increase `delay` or reduce `tolerance` in TouchSensor

### Issue: Desktop drag not smooth enough
**Solution:** MouseSensor has no constraints - it should be instant. Check for other performance issues.
