# Quick Setup Guide - Archive Feature

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

In your Supabase SQL Editor, run:

```sql
-- Add archived functionality to tasks table
ALTER TABLE public.tasks 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS archived BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE public.tasks 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS archived_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tasks_archived ON public.tasks(archived);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tasks_board_archived ON public.tasks(board_id, archived);

-- Add comments
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.tasks.archived IS 'Whether the task is archived (hidden from board)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.tasks.archived_at IS 'Timestamp when the task was archived';
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

**Check the components are in place:**
- ‚úÖ `components/archived-tasks-dialog.tsx` - Created
- ‚úÖ `components/edit-task-dialog.tsx` - Updated with archive button
- ‚úÖ `components/supabase-kanban-board.tsx` - Integrated archive functionality
- ‚úÖ `lib/api/boards.ts` - Added archive/unarchive/getArchivedTasks functions

### Step 3: Test the Feature

1. **Start your dev server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to your board**

3. **Archive a task:**
   - Click any task to edit it
   - Click the "Archive" button at the bottom
   - Confirm the action
   - Task should disappear from board

4. **View archived tasks:**
   - Click the "Archived" button (next to "Add Task")
   - You should see your archived task

5. **Restore a task:**
   - In the Archived dialog, click "Restore" on any task
   - Task should reappear on the board

## üîí Security & Performance

### Database Level:
- RLS policies enforce user access control
- Indexes optimize archive queries
- Timestamps track archive history

### Application Level:
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Input validation on all operations
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### API Functions:

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Basic Flow:
1. ‚úÖ Create a new task
2. ‚úÖ Archive the task
3. ‚úÖ Verify it's in archived view
4. ‚úÖ Restore the task
5. ‚úÖ Verify it's back on board

### Edge Cases:
- Archive task from different columns
- Archive multiple tasks
- Test rate limiting (try 15 archives quickly)
- Archive tasks with/without categories
- Archive tasks with long descriptions
- Switch boards (archives should be board-specific)

### Error Handling:
- Disconnect network during archive
- Try to archive non-existent task
- Exceed rate limit
- Invalid board ID

## üìù Notes

- Archived tasks are **board-specific**
- Archived tasks **do not count** toward board display
- Archived tasks **retain their position** data (for potential future use)
- Deleting a board **cascades to archived tasks** (they get deleted too)
- Archived tasks can be **permanently deleted** from archive view
